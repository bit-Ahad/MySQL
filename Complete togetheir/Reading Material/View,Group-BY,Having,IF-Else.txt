Sure! Let’s go through each MySQL concept **simply and shortly** 👇

---

### 🪟 1. **Views**

A **view** is like a *saved query* — you can treat it like a table.

```sql
CREATE VIEW employee_view AS
SELECT name, salary FROM employees WHERE salary > 50000;

-- Use it like a table:
SELECT * FROM employee_view;
```

📝 **Use:** simplify complex queries or hide sensitive columns.

---

### 🔗 2. **JOIN**

Used to combine data from two or more tables.

| Type           | Description        | Example |
| -------------- | ------------------ | ------- |
| **INNER JOIN** | only matching rows |         |

```sql
SELECT employees.name, departments.dept_name
FROM employees
INNER JOIN departments ON employees.dept_id = departments.id;
```

| **LEFT JOIN** | all from left + matching right |

```sql
SELECT e.name, d.dept_name
FROM employees e
LEFT JOIN departments d ON e.dept_id = d.id;
```

📝 **Use:** connect related data (like employees & departments) or Two Tables.

---

### 🧮 3. **GROUP BY**

Used to group rows that have the same value.

```sql
SELECT dept_id, COUNT(*) AS total_employees
FROM employees
GROUP BY dept_id;
```

📝 **Use:** for summary reports (like totals, averages).

---

### 🔍 4. **HAVING**

Used *after GROUP BY* to filter grouped results.

```sql
SELECT dept_id, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY dept_id
HAVING avg_salary > 50000;
```

📝 **Use:** filter after aggregation (can’t use `WHERE` for that).

---

### ⚖️ 5. **IF / CASE (conditional)**

Used to apply logic in queries.

IF(condition, value_if_true, value_if_false)

```sql
SELECT name,
       IF(salary > 50000, 'High', 'Low') AS salary_level
FROM employees;
```

CASE — multiple if-else:
multiple if-else

```sql
CASE
    WHEN condition1 THEN value1
    WHEN condition2 THEN value2
    ELSE value3
END


SELECT name,
       CASE
           WHEN salary >= 80000 THEN 'Very High'
           WHEN salary >= 50000 THEN 'High'
           ELSE 'Low'
       END AS salary_level
FROM employees;


```

📝 **Use:** make decisions inside queries.
