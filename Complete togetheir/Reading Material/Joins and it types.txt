# 🌟 **What Are JOINs in MySQL?**

A **JOIN** is used to combine rows from two or more tables **based on a related column** between them.

Think of it like matching data from two lists where one column connects them.

Example:

* Table **students** (student_id, name)
* Table **marks** (student_id, score)
  You use a JOIN to show each student *with* their marks.

# 🔥 **Types of JOINs in MySQL (Easy Explanation)**

---

## 1️⃣ **INNER JOIN**

👉 Shows **only the matching rows** from both tables.

**Think:** “Give me only what exists in both tables.”

### **Example**

```sql
SELECT students.name, marks.score
FROM students
INNER JOIN marks
ON students.student_id = marks.student_id;
```

✔ Shows students **who have marks recorded**.
❌ Students without marks will NOT appear.

---

## 2️⃣ **LEFT JOIN** (Left Outer Join)

👉 Shows **all rows from the left table**, and matching rows from the right table.
If no match → shows **NULL**.

**Think:** “Give me everything from the left table, even if there's no match.”

### **Example**

```sql
SELECT students.name, marks.score
FROM students
LEFT JOIN marks
ON students.student_id = marks.student_id;
```

✔ Shows **all students**, including those who **don’t have marks** yet.

---

## 3️⃣ **RIGHT JOIN** (Right Outer Join)

👉 Opposite of LEFT JOIN.
Shows **all rows from the right table**, and matching rows from the left.

**Think:** “Give me everything from the right table.”

### **Example**

```sql
SELECT students.name, marks.score
FROM students
RIGHT JOIN marks
ON students.student_id = marks.student_id;
```

✔ All rows from **marks** table will appear.
❌ Students without marks will NOT appear.

---

## 4️⃣ **FULL JOIN** (Full Outer Join)

❗ **MySQL doesn’t support FULL JOIN directly**, but you can simulate it.

👉 Shows **all rows** when there is a match in either table.

**Think:** “Show me everything from both tables.”

### **Simulated FULL JOIN**

```sql
SELECT *
FROM students
LEFT JOIN marks ON students.student_id = marks.student_id
UNION
SELECT *
FROM students
RIGHT JOIN marks ON students.student_id = marks.student_id;
```

---

## 5️⃣ **CROSS JOIN**

👉 Combines **every row of table A** with **every row of table B**.

**Think:** “Mix everything with everything.”

### **Example**

Table A has 2 rows; Table B has 3 rows → result = **6 rows**

```sql
SELECT *
FROM students
CROSS JOIN marks;
```

---

## 6️⃣ **SELF JOIN**

👉 A table joins with **itself**.

**Think:** “Compare rows from the same table.”

### Example

Finding employees with the same manager:

```sql
SELECT A.name, B.name AS coworker
FROM employees A
JOIN employees B
ON A.manager_id = B.manager_id;
```

# 🎯 **Quick Summary Table**

| Join Type      | What It Returns                                |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| **INNER JOIN** | Only matching rows                             |
| **LEFT JOIN**  | All from left + matches                        |
| **RIGHT JOIN** | All from right + matches                       |
| **FULL JOIN**  | All rows from both sides (not direct in MySQL) |
| **CROSS JOIN** | Every combination                              |
| **SELF JOIN**  | Table joined with itself                       |
