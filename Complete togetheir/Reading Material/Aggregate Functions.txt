### 1. **`COUNT()`** – Count Rows

Returns the number of rows in a table or number of non-NULL values in a column.

```sql
-- Count all rows
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM employees;

-- Count non-NULL values in a column
SELECT COUNT(salary) FROM employees;
```

---

### 2. **`SUM()`** – Sum of Values

Returns the total sum of a numeric column.

```sql
SELECT SUM(salary) AS total_salary FROM employees;
```

---

### 3. **`AVG()`** – Average

Returns the average value of a numeric column.

```sql
SELECT AVG(salary) AS avg_salary FROM employees;
```

---

### 4. **`MIN()`** – Minimum Value

Returns the smallest value in a column.

```sql
SELECT MIN(salary) AS min_salary FROM employees;
```

---

### 5. **`MAX()`** – Maximum Value

Returns the largest value in a column.

```sql
SELECT MAX(salary) AS max_salary FROM employees;
```

---

### ✅ Combined Example

Suppose we have a table `employees` with a `salary` column:

```sql
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) AS total_employees,
    SUM(salary) AS total_salary,
    AVG(salary) AS average_salary,
    MIN(salary) AS min_salary,
    MAX(salary) AS max_salary
FROM employees;
```

This will give you **all five aggregate results in a single row**.
